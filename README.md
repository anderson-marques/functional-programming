# Functional Programming

About functional Programming.

## Context

Reactive programming and reactive architectures are trend topics nowadays. Machines get powered with dozens of cores. Old programming languages were updated, new ones were created and new frameworks were developed to make better usage of the machines as well trying to reduce bugs. Functional programming was created decades ago but became popularized again in the last years.

## Definition

> Functional Programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

> Declarative programming paradigm

> It has it roots in lambda calculus

## History

- Functional programming was born in the 60's.

## Pros

- No state issues related to state manipulation.
- Naturally reusable and testable, since it depends only on their arguments.
- Safe for multithreading. It make a better usage of CPU cores.

## Cons

- Less efficient code since it does not have loops (use recursion, instead)
- Harder to understand depending on the solution (function as arguments, for instance)

## Mathematical Representation

- `Input x -> Function X -> Output f(x)` 

A function X receives its arguments and generates the output f(x). The arguments and output also be functions. There is no variable. Everything is constant.


## Languages and Frameworks

- Js (ReactiveX)
- Java 8/9 (Lambdas, RxJava, Flow API, Kotlin)
